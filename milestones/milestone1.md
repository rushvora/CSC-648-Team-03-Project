##3. **Data Definitions**

  1. **Unregistered User**- This kind of user will be able to fully browse all products that are viewable on the site.  However, they will not be allowed to purchase, sell, or contact **registered users** unless they themselves become a **registered user** by using their **SFSU email** to sign up.  Sign up will be possible by both a sign in button located on the page or when the user tries to contact the **seller** in order to make a purchase.

  2. **Registered User**- After going through the process of registration this type of user will retain all of the privileges of an **unregistered user** as well as now being able to contact **sellers** in order to purchase a **product** from them and report improper use of the site to the **admin**.  Along with these privileges they will also themselves be able to post **products** to the site thus becoming a **seller**.

  3. **Seller**- A **registered user** will have the option to post **products** to the site in order to make contact with other **registered users** that may be interested in purchasing an item from them.  They will be responsible for providing at least one image, the price, as well as a short description of what the **product** is and its current state.  It will be between this **seller** and **registered user** to determine the amount for the product as well as the form of payment. This will be facilitated by the site by providing a contact email address to the **seller** when the **register user** shows interest in buying the **product**.  

  4. **Admin**- Will be in charge of making sure the site is being run correctly by having the ability to browse through all **registered user product** listings as well as a list of all **registered users**.  From these lists the **admin** will have the ability to remove any **product** postings as well as **registered users** if the need arises such as the item being sold is illegal.  The **admin** will not however have the ability to edit any listings or **registered user** information as well as not being able to place any **product** posts of their own.

  5. **San Francisco State University Email**- An **SFSU email** account is required from a user in order to register or sign in.  It is the only information that will be taken from a **registered user** that will be authenticated as it will help prove that the user is associated with SFSU as well as being the first contact point between a **seller** and potential **registered user** buyer.

  6. **???Product???**- The **products** that will be able to be sold on the site will have to be legal items.  **Product** price, description, and image will be set by the **seller** but will be able to be removed by the **admin** if the **product** does not meet the siteâ€™s **product** requirements. 

  7. **CAPTCHA**- A program that will be used to authenticate whether or not the user signing in or registering is not a bot.
